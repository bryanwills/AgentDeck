// The encoder OFFLINE banner (renderOfflineTouchStrip) is an all-or-nothing
// 800px design across 4 encoders, and its messaging ("launch the app") is only
// meaningful when the daemon WS is truly down. Dials must gate the banner on
// THIS flag — set only on real connect/disconnect — never on session-level
// `currentState === DISCONNECTED`, which flips transiently during multi-session
// switching while the daemon stays connected (mirrors the keypad's policy in
// session-slot-button.ts). Kept separate from that module's daemonConnected,
// which has keypad-only side effects (clears sessions, exits detail view).

// The encoder option-TAKEOVER (E1–E4 commandeered for AWAITING option/permission
// selection) was retired in the Phase 2 SD+ redesign: E2/E3 now permanently show
// Claude/Codex usage, and option/permission selection lives on the keypad detail
// view (session-slot). The takeover cross-module callback cycles were removed
// along with encoder-takeover.ts. The voice-text takeover that also borrowed
// these LCDs went with the Voice dial.
