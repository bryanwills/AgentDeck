# Install & Build from Source

Prerequisites, manual build steps, and uninstall. Most people want the
one-command path in [README → Start here](../README.md#start-here) instead.

## Prerequisites

| Item | Required | Install |
|------|----------|---------|
| **macOS 26+** | Yes (App Store dashboard) | Primary Swift dashboard platform. Foundation Models integration requires Apple Intelligence availability at runtime. |
| **macOS 15+** (Sequoia) | Yes (Node bridge) | CLI daemon / Stream Deck plugin host. Windows 11 bridge support is below; Linux not supported |
| **Xcode Command Line Tools** | Only if the prebuilt fails | `xcode-select --install`. `npx @agentdeck/setup` installs node-pty's prebuilt binary and falls back to a source build — which is the only step needing a compiler |
| **Node.js** >= 22 | Yes | `brew install node` |
| **pnpm** >= 9 | Yes | `npm install -g pnpm` |
| **Python 3** | Yes | `brew install python` (display sleep detection) |
| **Elgato Stream Deck app** >= 6.7 | For Stream Deck only | [Elgato Downloads](https://www.elgato.com/downloads). The daemon runs headless — D200H, the macOS app, `agentdeck dashboard` and ESP32 boards need none of it |
| **Elgato Stream Deck hardware** | For Stream Deck only | 15-key, Mini, or Stream Deck+ |
| **iTerm2** | For PTY session management | Terminal management, voice paste, session switching |
| **Claude Code CLI** | Yes | `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` |
| **JDK 17+** | For Android | `brew install openjdk@17` |
| **Stream Deck CLI** | Auto | Installed by `pnpm setup` if missing |
| **Microphone + Speech Recognition** | For voice | Grant on first use (macOS Settings → Privacy). No sox, whisper, or model download — Apple SFSpeech on-device |

## Manual Build & Install

## Build

```bash
cd AgentDeck
pnpm install
pnpm build            # shared → bridge, plugin, hooks
pnpm generate-icons   # SVG → PNG (required on first build)
```

## 1. Install Claude Code Hooks

**Node CLI install (dev + Homebrew distribution):**

```bash
node hooks/dist/install.js
```

Registers 7 hooks in `~/.claude/settings.local.json`: `SessionStart`, `SessionEnd`, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`, `Stop`, `Notification`, `UserPromptSubmit`. Each hook POSTs JSON to the bridge. Remove with `node hooks/dist/install.js uninstall`.

**Mac App Store install:** [download AgentDeck Dashboard](https://apps.apple.com/app/id6784822497) for the standalone macOS app. Hooks are **opt-in** — the app shows a Settings → Claude Code Hooks pane with an "Enable Claude Code Hooks…" button that presents an NSAlert explaining what will be written, then an NSOpenPanel so the user explicitly selects `~/.claude/settings.json` (the user-global file Claude Code watches; the CLI installer above uses `settings.local.json`). Only after that consent does AgentDeck write the hook entries (via a security-scoped bookmark). "Remove" in the same pane cleanly unregisters and revokes the bookmark. No command line required.

## 2. Link Stream Deck Plugin

```bash
cd plugin && streamdeck link bound.serendipity.agentdeck.sdPlugin
```

Creates a symlink in `~/Library/Application Support/com.elgato.StreamDeck/Plugins/`. **Restart the Stream Deck app** to load.

## 3. Link `agentdeck` CLI

```bash
cd bridge && pnpm link --global
```

## 4. Voice Setup (Zero install)

Voice input uses Apple's on-device `SFSpeechRecognizer` (Speech framework). **No sox, no whisper.cpp, no model downloads** — the OS manages the dictation model via Settings → General → Keyboard → Dictation, which AgentDeck piggybacks on. The only user action is granting Microphone + Speech Recognition permission the first time the voice button is pressed (macOS shows the standard TCC prompts backed by `NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` and `NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription`).

All audio stays on-device (`requiresOnDeviceRecognition = true`), so the captured WAV — which may contain project/code names — never leaves the machine. See [Voice Setup Guide](voice-setup.md) for permission troubleshooting and wake-word details.

## Uninstall

```bash
bash scripts/uninstall.sh
```

Removes Claude Code hooks, unlinks `agentdeck` CLI, and removes the Stream Deck plugin symlink. **Restart the Stream Deck app** afterward.
