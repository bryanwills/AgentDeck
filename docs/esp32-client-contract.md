# AgentDeck ESP32 Client Contract

The wire contract a **display-only AgentDeck client** must honour to render live agent
state and (optionally) steer sessions. This is the human-readable subset of the protocol
that a board firmware implements; the machine-readable source of truth is
[`shared/src/protocol.ts`](../shared/src/protocol.ts), and the reference first-party
implementation is [`esp32/src/net/protocol.cpp`](../esp32/src/net/protocol.cpp).

**Who this is for.** First-party `esp32/` boards already implement the full contract. This
doc exists so a *third-party or forked* firmware — today the **XTeink X3** (an external
CrossPoint Reader fork, `crosspoint-agentdeck`; see
[hardware-compatibility.md](hardware-compatibility.md) footnote ⁷) — can port a minimal,
correct client without reading the whole 39KB reference parser. The X3's `src/agentdeck/`
is explicitly a *"TRIMMED port of AgentDeck esp32/src/net/protocol"*; this is the contract
it ports **from**. When the events or `device_info` fields below change, that port must be
re-synced — see [esp32.md § Downstream client port sync](esp32.md#downstream-client-port-sync).

There is **no C/C++ codegen** for this contract. `pnpm generate-protocol` emits Swift and
Kotlin only; quicktype's C++ output (exceptions, `std::string`, nlohmann/json) is unusable
on a no-PSRAM RISC-V target that parses with ArduinoJson. Even the first-party `esp32/`
firmware hand-writes its parser. Codegen is not the drift guard — this doc plus the
port-sync discipline is.

## Transport

- **WiFi WebSocket** to the daemon on **port 9120** (`BRIDGE_WS_PORT`), discovered via mDNS
  `_agentdeck._tcp`. Reconnect with backoff (`RECONNECT_BACKOFF_MS` ladder 1→2→4→8s). Also
  the fallback UDP-broadcast discovery on 9121 that the X3 port carries.
- **USB Serial JSON** (115200, newline-framed) is the other first-party transport. A
  WiFi-only client (X3, InkDeck) can skip serial, but then it is only registrable once it
  emits `device_info` over WS (see below).
- Frames are single-line JSON. Reject anything larger than `PROTOCOL_MAX_MSG_BYTES` before
  feeding an elastic JSON document — an unbounded `sessions_list`/`timeline_history` will
  otherwise fragment/exhaust the heap on no-PSRAM boards.

## Inbound — messages the client parses

Dispatch on the top-level `"type"`. The forwarded sets are defined in `protocol.ts`
(`DISPLAY_FORWARDED_EVENTS` ⊂ `SERIAL_FORWARDED_EVENTS`).

**Minimum viable client (the X3's "M2" subset):**

| `type` | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `state_update` | Per-session state (idle / processing / awaiting_* …). The primary render input. |
| `sessions_list` | Full session roster — id, agent type, state, label. Each session also carries `activity`: a clean one-liner ("Editing auth.ts") from the shared activity pipeline — **render this, not the raw `currentTool`** ("Bash"). Both the Node bridge and the in-process Swift daemon now populate it; fall back to `currentTool`/`currentTask`/`goal` only when `activity` is empty. Sessions with a recent milestone also carry the daemon-computed `lastEventText` (≤99 bytes, the newest chat/task row text), optional `lastEventTask` (≤39 bytes, resolved enclosing-task label) and `lastEventHm` ("HH:MM" host-local) — the TIMELINE-parity "what happened last" line; card-style surfaces should prefer `lastEventHm + lastEventTask + lastEventText` over reconstructing it from the on-device timeline ring (which starts empty after every reboot). Absent fields are omitted, never empty strings. |
| `usage_update` | Subscription / rate-limit gauges (Claude 5h, Codex, Antigravity, …). |
| `connection` / `connected` | Connect/disconnect ack. Actual link state is tracked by WS event callbacks; these are logged for diagnostics. |

**Fuller set — parse if you render it, otherwise accept-and-ignore is acceptable:**

| `type` | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `timeline_event` | Incremental activity-log row. `ts` is epoch-ms; entries also carry `localHm` = daemon host-local "HH:MM" (both daemons stamp it now) — RTC-less clients render `localHm` for the wall time rather than deriving from `ts` in UTC. |
| `timeline_history` | Backfill of recent timeline rows on (re)connect. |
| `display_state` | Host display on/off + optional `dim {enabled, mode, level}`. Absent `dim` ⇒ legacy full-off. Level is percent 1–100 → scale to the board's backlight domain, floored at 1. |
| `wifi_provision` | Credentials pushed over serial (USB provisioning flow). |
| `set_orientation` | `landscape` bool; portrait↔landscape toggle. |
| `device_info_request` | Reply with `device_info` (see below). **The X3 stubs this today — which is exactly why it is not dashboard-visible.** |

A display-only client may ignore the OTA frames (`esp32_ota_begin/chunk/end/abort`) unless
it opts into WiFi OTA with a dual-OTA partition table.

## Outbound — messages the client emits

### `device_info` (identity + capability announcement)

Emitted on connect and in reply to `device_info_request`, over **both** transports.
`device_info.board` is the **SSOT match key** the daemon and `agentdeck esp32-ota` use to
route to a board; a client that never emits it never appears on the dashboard. Fields (from
`sendDeviceInfo`, `esp32/src/net/protocol.cpp`):

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `board` | Canonical wire string, underscore convention. First-party: `ulanzi_tc001`, `inkdeck`, `ttgo_t_display`, `esp32_c6_147`, `round_amoled`, `86box`, `ips_10`, `ips_35`. External CrossPoint fork: `xteink_x3`, `xteink_x4` (one firmware, runtime-detected). Registration accepts **any** board string (the Node daemon coerces only a *missing* field to `unknown`); a board needs an `ESP32_OTA_BOARDS` entry **only** to be OTA-targetable by name — and only if it has an `esp32/` pio env, which the fork boards do not (they flash via SD `update.bin`). |
| `version` | `FIRMWARE_VERSION`. |
| `buildHash` | `GIT_SHA` — the authoritative deploy-verification field (`version` alone can't distinguish a stale flash). |
| `buildEpoch` | Build timestamp (uint32). |
| `protocolRevision` | `PROTOCOL_REVISION`. |
| `wifiConfigured` / `wifiConnected` | Provisioning + link state. `ip` when connected. |
| `otaSupported`, `otaSlotCount`, `otaSlotSize`, `otaFreeSketchSpace`, `otaReason` | OTA capability. `otaReason` only when unsupported. |
| `timelineCount`, `sessionCount`, `usageFiveH`, `processingCount` | Debug aids — let a host-side probe (`daemon /devices`) distinguish "data never parsed" from "render gating" without stealing the serial port. |

### Command frames (steering — optional)

A client with buttons can steer sessions. Two prompt shapes:

- **Observed gate** (`requestId` present) → `{"type":"permission_decision","requestId":"<id>","decision":"allow|deny"}`
- **Managed PTY prompt** (no `requestId`, `sessionId` present) → approve = `{"type":"select_option","index":0[,"sessionId":"<sid>"]}`; escape = `{"type":"session_command","sessionId":"<sid>","command":{"type":"escape"}}`
- `{"type":"query_session_timeline","sessionId":"<sid>"}` — request a session's Detail timeline on demand (glance-surface backfill).

## Relationship to the reference implementation

- First-party boards: [`esp32/src/net/protocol.cpp`](../esp32/src/net/protocol.cpp) (full
  parser + `sendDeviceInfo` + OTA).
- X3 port: `crosspoint-agentdeck` `src/agentdeck/{ws_client,protocol,mdns_discovery,udp_discovery,agent_state,agent_commands}.*`.
  Its known M3 gap is `device_info` emission (plus `display_state`/`set_orientation`).
- Change discipline: edits to `DISPLAY_FORWARDED_EVENTS`/`SERIAL_FORWARDED_EVENTS` in
  `protocol.ts` or to the `device_info` field list must be reflected into both the
  first-party parser and the X3 port. See the port-sync sections in
  [esp32.md](esp32.md#downstream-client-port-sync) (AgentDeck side) and the fork's
  `.skills/SKILL.md` (fork side).
