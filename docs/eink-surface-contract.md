# E-ink Surface Contract

This is the source of truth for the **meaning and arbitration** of AgentDeck
e-ink faces. Pixel layout remains board-specific. Wire compatibility remains in
[AgentDeck Surface Protocol](surface-protocol.md), and physical numeric
specifications remain in [Hardware Compatibility](hardware-compatibility.md).

The governing test is: **is this still worth reading in ten minutes?** A fact
that does not pass that test belongs in the transient band, not the body, and
does not earn a panel refresh.

## 1. Two layers

- The **body** is server-authored durable meaning. The current ESP32 renderer
  maps structured daemon state into board-specific pixels; a daemon-rendered
  framebuffer is also valid. Firmware may choose geometry, but it must not
  reinterpret transient tool churn as a new face.
- The **band** is a small on-device status line: which session may speak next,
  current transport/activity state, and an absolute `as of HH:MM` timestamp.
  `PROCESSING`, tool churn, reconnecting, and similar transients are band words,
  never faces.

## 2. Face definitions

| Face | Admission contract |
|---|---|
| `DECISION` | A real actionable request with structured choices or a request ID. It is the only face that may preempt an unheld body. Bare waiting/processing state is not a decision. |
| `ANSWER` | A durable receipt: the immutable user transcript above the answer, an absolute timestamp, delivery result, and retry affordance. |
| `DIGEST` | A producer-sealed, immutable, bounded document with an absolute creation time. It is summoned and paged; it never becomes a live scrolling log. |
| `GLANCE` | The normal resting face: durable state and explicit age only. No activity feed or seconds-level status. |
| `ROSTER` | Static no-content/no-daemon fallback. It is not the normal dashboard and contains no live session choreography. |

`DECISION > ANSWER > DIGEST > GLANCE > ROSTER` is the strict priority among
faces that are eligible in the current delivery mode.

## 3. Push and pull change the face set

Push/pull is not a refresh-rate tuning knob. It changes which face states can be
reached.

- **Push base set:** `{DECISION, ANSWER, DIGEST, GLANCE, ROSTER}`. The device is
  continuously reachable and may receive unsolicited durable work.
- **Pull base set:** `{DIGEST, GLANCE, ROSTER}`. A sleeping device cannot promise
  unsolicited decisions or answers.
- A physical wake on a pull device opens an **interactive lease** for at most
  eight minutes. During that lease its eligible set is temporarily promoted to
  the push set, so a user-initiated PTT turn can produce `ANSWER` and a real
  decision can surface. Escape or lease expiry returns directly to `GLANCE` and
  restores the pull base set.

Power source does not silently select delivery mode. In particular, plugging a
battery board into USB for development does not make it push-capable unless its
firmware or configuration explicitly declares a continuously reachable push
mode.

## 4. Arbitration and holds

1. Admit only content that satisfies its face contract, then select the highest
   eligible priority.
2. A physical user action (button or accepted speech) holds the current body for
   eight minutes. Repeated actions renew the same bounded hold; they do not make
   it infinite.
3. During a hold, a higher-priority event may announce itself in the band but
   cannot steal the body.
4. Escape always cancels the hold and interactive lease and returns to
   `GLANCE`. It does not mean Deny, cancel the agent, or interrupt a session.
5. Expiry has the same surface result as escape: `GLANCE`, followed by normal
   arbitration on a later cycle. There is no hidden forever screen.

## 5. Board binding and invariant controls

| Board | Delivery mode | Deep-sleep wake | PTT | Physical controls |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| InkDeck / Seeed TRMNL 7.5 | **Push**; USB-powered and continuously reachable | Not used by current firmware | None (no microphone) | `KEY1` cycles durable pages; `KEY2` returns to the live AgentDeck board |
| RockBase NM-EPD-420 | **Pull** by default; explicit tethered configuration may promote it to push | `BOOT` / GPIO0 | `BOOT` hold remains reserved until the ES8311 capture path is enabled. Playback is live: the codec answers at 0x18 (probed 2026-08-30) and the board advertises `audio_out`. | Home: `BOOT` opens/pages, `USER` returns home. Decision: `BOOT` advances the highlighted option; `USER` selects, then confirms it. |
| LilyGo T5 ePaper S3 / EPD47 | **Pull** | User button / GPIO21; `BOOT` / GPIO0 is recovery fallback. Touch IRQ GPIO47 is not a wake source without a hardware reroute. | None (no onboard microphone) | Detected touch selects tabs/options; the owned unit answers at 0x5D once its P6 FPC is seated. Tabs render as plates and decision options drop their numeric prefix when a controller is present. If touch is unavailable, GPIO21 cycles `FOCUS → QUEUE → LIMITS`. |

On pull boards, a physical primary/wake action starts the eight-minute
interactive lease. Outside that lease, `DECISION` and `ANSWER` are ineligible;
loss of the daemon selects the static `ROSTER` fallback. The current NM build
reserves a fresh `BOOT` hold for PTT but does not yet enable the ES8311 capture
driver. Until capture lands, the retained footer documents only implemented
short-press controls and does not advertise a non-working talk action.

EPD47 specializes `GLANCE` into three touch tabs without changing the face
priority contract: no active durable work selects `LIMITS`, one attention or
processing session selects `FOCUS`, and two or more select `QUEUE`. A tab tap
holds that page for eight minutes; expiry returns to the automatic selection.
The controller is advertised as a `touch` capability only after a successful
boot probe. GPIO21 becomes a deterministic tab-cycle fallback when touch is absent.

The NM audio path is deliberately half-duplex at the product level: codec and
speaker amplifier stay disabled during capture, then may be enabled for a short
confirmation cue after capture. Printed `ANSWER` is the response; speech output
is not required. A future wake/hold implementation must still separate the wake
release from a fresh capture hold.

## 6. Evaluation telemetry

E-ink firmware that owns the panel SHOULD emit two optional `device_info`
counters, both monotonic since boot:

- `repaintCount`: actual physical panel refreshes after content and rate gates;
- `fullRefreshCount`: the full-window subset of `repaintCount`.

The counters reset on reboot and may be absent on older or non-e-ink firmware.
Both daemons expose them over serial and WiFi so a redesign can be evaluated
without replaying logs by hand. See the field-level contract in
[ESP32 Client Contract](esp32-client-contract.md).
