// PairingKnockStore.swift — who tried to connect, and who the operator let in.
//
// The daemon already knew everything this needs: it refuses an unauthenticated
// LAN peer at the WebSocket handshake and logs the IP. What it did not do was
// tell anyone. So a device with no credential retried forever into a log nobody
// reads (measured on this machine: one reader knocked 116 times and then went
// quiet for three weeks; another is still knocking every few seconds), while the
// only ways to give it a credential asked the DEVICE to do something — scan a
// QR, type six digits, type a 32-character token. An e-ink reader can do none
// of them comfortably, and one with no camera cannot do the first at all.
//
// Turning the refusal into a prompt inverts that: the device does nothing, and
// the operator — who is holding the Mac — approves a peer they can see. That is
// also the stronger of the two trust models. A pairing code trusts whoever knows
// a secret, so anyone in range may guess at it while the window is open; an
// approval trusts a specific peer the operator pointed at, and an attacker
// cannot approve themselves.
//
// Three properties this file has to keep.
//
// **Identity is the device id when the client sends one, and the address only
// when it does not.** The refusal happens at the HTTP upgrade, before any frame
// — `client_register`, where a device says its name, arrives only after a socket
// exists — so the daemon must learn who this is from the handshake itself. A
// client that sends `x-agentdeck-device` is approved as that device: two
// devices behind one NAT are told apart, a DHCP lease change does not retire
// the grant, and one device can be revoked without touching the token the whole
// fleet shares.
//
// The address remains the key for clients that send no id, and that path must
// keep working: every device already in the field predates the header, and
// refusing them would turn an upgrade into a fleet-wide outage. An IP-keyed
// approval carries the old caveats — it retires when the lease changes, and
// behind NAT it is not an identity at all — so the UI labels which kind a row
// is instead of letting them read alike.
//
// Neither kind is proof. The link is plaintext `ws://`, so a device id in the
// handshake is replayable by a passive observer on the same segment — exactly
// as true of the `?token=` every paired device already carries. This is no
// weaker than what ships today; it buys granularity and revocation, not
// secrecy. Unforgeable identity needs a challenge-response over a channel that
// is not plaintext, which is separate work this does not pretend to.
//
// **A claimed name is never identity.** Nothing here reads one. If a name is
// ever surfaced it must sit beside the address, never instead of it.
//
// **Bounded, and expired on read.** A hostile peer must not be able to grow this
// list without limit, so it is capped and the oldest knock is dropped — which
// does mean a flood can push a real device out of view, and the cap is chosen
// high enough that a human notices the flood first. Expiry is evaluated when the
// list is read, never by a timer: a timer that fires late on a sleeping laptop
// would keep a stale knock alive past its promise, exactly as in
// PairingWindowStore.
//
// Lock-based rather than actor-isolated on purpose: the WebSocket accept path
// calls `isApproved` synchronously before it may upgrade, and an actor hop there
// would mean answering the handshake from a different turn. Same reasoning, and
// same shape, as AuthManager.
