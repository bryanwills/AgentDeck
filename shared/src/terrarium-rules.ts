// terrarium-rules.ts — Cross-platform terrarium behavior rules (SSOT).
//
// This file is the single source of truth for terrarium *rules*: numeric
// invariants every surface must agree on regardless of its own world model
// (creature homes that are unified across dashboards, exclusion zones,
// rest strips). Surface-specific *tuning* (per-board Y offsets, swim lanes,
// sprite sizes) stays local to each platform.
//
// Consumers:
//   TypeScript  — import { TERRARIUM_RULES } from '@agentdeck/shared'
//                 (TUI terrarium, Pixoo renderer, future web surfaces)
//   Swift       — apple/AgentDeck/Terrarium/TerrariumRules.generated.swift
//   Kotlin      — android/.../terrarium/TerrariumRules.generated.kt
//   C++ (ESP32) — esp32/src/ui/terrarium/terrarium_rules_generated.h
//
// The Swift/Kotlin/C++ files are GENERATED — run `pnpm generate-terrarium-rules`
// after editing this file and commit the regenerated outputs. A vitest sync
// test (shared/src/__tests__/terrarium-rules.test.ts) fails CI when the
// generated files drift from this source, so hand-editing them cannot stick.
//
// When adding a new cross-platform rule (a coordinate, clamp, or zone that
// more than one surface must respect), add it HERE first, regenerate, and
// wire each surface to the generated constant — never introduce the literal
// in platform code. That is what keeps new features from re-fragmenting.

/**
 * Terrarium cross-platform rules.
 *
 * crayfish — the OpenClaw crayfish's unified dashboard home and territory.
 *   `clearMaxX` is the load-bearing invariant: idle/sleeping floor-resting
 *   drifters (OpenCode, sleeping Antigravity, idle Cloud) must clamp their
 *   rest anchor X to ≤ clearMaxX so the crayfish's floor territory (claws
 *   reach ~homeX − widthFrac) stays clear. Fix origin: 610fe15c — idle
 *   OpenCode landed exactly on the crayfish when two sessions were idle.
 *
 * floorRestStrip — the sand strip idle drifters converge to on the full
 *   dashboard surfaces (macOS/Android). Y is surface-tunable elsewhere
 *   (TUI floor ≈ 0.88, ESP32 SleepY per board); the strip here documents
 *   the canonical dashboard band.
 *
 * antigravityHoverStrip — Antigravity idles as a HOVER, not a floor rest:
 *   its band extends to x 0.82 (inside crayfish territory), so landing it
 *   would collide. Hover Y band for the full dashboard surfaces.
 *
 * resterMaxWidthFrac — widest floor-resting creature body (Antigravity,
 *   0.096; see creature-layout.ts band specs). Input to the clearance
 *   invariant: clearMaxX + resterMaxWidthFrac/2 < crayfish claw left edge.
