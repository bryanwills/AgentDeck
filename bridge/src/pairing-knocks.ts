/**
 * Who tried to connect, and who the operator let in — the Node daemon's half
 * of the operator-approval credential path (`PairingKnockStore.swift`).
 *
 * The daemon already knew everything this needs: it refuses an unauthenticated
 * LAN peer at the WebSocket handshake and logs the address. What it did not do
 * was tell anyone. So a device with no credential retried forever into a log
 * nobody reads, while every way to give it a credential asked the DEVICE to do
 * something — scan a QR, type six digits, type a 32-character token. An e-ink
 * reader can do none of them comfortably, and one with no camera cannot do the
 * first at all.
 *
 * Turning the refusal into a prompt inverts that: the device does nothing, and
 * the operator — who is holding the machine — approves a peer they can see.
 * That is also the stronger of the two trust models. A pairing code trusts
 * whoever knows a secret, so anyone in range may guess at it while the window
 * is open; an approval trusts a specific peer the operator pointed at, and an
 * attacker cannot approve themselves.
 *
 * This file is the Node parity port. It is deliberately a near-transliteration
 * of the Swift store rather than a re-derivation: both daemons take turns
 * owning port 9120 and they read each other's state, so a rule that is restated
 * in this file's own words is a rule that can drift. The properties below are
 * the ones that must hold in both.
 *
 * **Identity is the device id when the client sends one, and the address only
 * when it does not.** The refusal happens at the HTTP upgrade, before any frame
 * — `client_register`, where a device says its name, arrives only after a
 * socket exists — so the daemon must learn who this is from the handshake
 * itself. A client that sends `x-agentdeck-device` is approved as that device:
 * two devices behind one NAT are told apart, a DHCP lease change does not
 * retire the grant, and one device can be revoked without touching the token
 * the whole fleet shares.
 *
 * The address remains the key for clients that send no id, and that path must
 * keep working: every device already in the field predates the header, and
 * refusing them would turn an upgrade into a fleet-wide outage. An IP-keyed
 * approval carries the old caveats — it retires when the lease changes, and
 * behind NAT it is not an identity at all — so a row says which kind it is
 * instead of letting the two read alike.
 *
 * Neither kind is proof. The link is plaintext `ws://`, so a device id in the
 * handshake is replayable by a passive observer on the same segment — exactly
 * as true of the `?token=` every paired device already carries. This is no
 * weaker than what ships today; it buys granularity and revocation, not
 * secrecy.
 *
 * **A claimed name is never identity.** Nothing here reads one. If a name is
 * ever surfaced it must sit beside the address, never instead of it.
 *
 * **Bounded, and expired on read.** A hostile peer must not be able to grow
 * this list without limit, so it is capped and the oldest knock is dropped —
 * which does mean a flood can push a real device out of view, and the cap is
 * chosen high enough that a human notices the flood first. Expiry is evaluated
 * when the list is read, never by a timer: a timer that fires late on a
 * sleeping laptop would keep a stale knock alive past its promise, exactly as
 * in `pairing-window.ts`.
