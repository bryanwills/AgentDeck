/**
 * Read the most recent turn's assistant text from a Claude Code transcript
 * JSONL file (path comes from the Stop hook's `transcript_path` field).
 *
 * Why this exists: the `last_assistant_message` field on the Stop hook payload
 * is only ~18% reliable (see DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md note). Pure-tool turns often
 * emit no assistant text, and text-bearing turns sometimes drop the field on
 * the hook boundary. The transcript JSONL is the authoritative source Claude
 * Code itself writes, with one JSON object per line capturing every user /
 * assistant / tool_use / tool_result event.
 *
 * Scope: CLI bridge only. The App Store Swift daemon runs under a sandbox
 * that only grants security-scoped access to `~/.claude/settings.json` — not
 * the per-session `~/.claude/projects/<proj>/<session>.jsonl` files. For that
 * build, Task 2's `response_kind` heuristic (empty text + tool_calls > 0 →
 * `tool_only`) is the fallback.
