/**
 * Which closed tasks the judge may score at all.
 *
 * The task rollup judge used to run on anything that carried text, and "text"
 * included the user's own prompts — so a task whose agent never answered was
 * scored against silence, a task whose only turn ended in a usage-limit abort
 * was scored on the abort notice ("Failed to send notifications due to
 * repeated session limits", 0%), and a `hello` was scored as a failed
 * planning task. Measured over one week (2026-09-03): 69 of 182 judged tasks
 * held no agent reply, at a mean 0.59 that then ranked beside real work on
 * the scorecard and floated to the top of the Work board's attention sort.
 *
 * A verdict about the agent's work needs the agent's work. This is the ONE
 * place that says what counts, so the runner and the reaper's enqueue gate
 * cannot drift apart. Reasons are surfaced on the task row rather than
 * silently skipped — a task the judge declined must say why, or "unjudged"
 * reads as a backlog.
